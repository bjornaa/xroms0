XROMS
=====

`xroms` is a package of post-processing tools for the ROMS
ocean model.

The implementation is based on the versatile xarray package,
giving DataArrays with named dimensions. It supersedes the older roppy package.

Naming follows the ROMS conventions.

This repository has been deprecated. Its functionality will be moved to
and further development will be done in Rob Hetlands
`xroms <https://github.com/hetland/xroms>`_ package.
The repository will stay at github but the name has changed from `xroms` to `xroms0`.
The name `xroms` will be used for a fork of the Hetland package.
