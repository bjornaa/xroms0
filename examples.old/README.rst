Example dataset
===============

Most of the examples uses a forcing file, ``ocean_avg_0014.nc``, from a ROMS
simulation.

This dataset is available with anonymous ftp from
``ftp.imr.no/bjorn/ladim-data``
or simpler by running the attached download script ``download.py``.

The example forcing consist of 3-days averages from a North
Sea downscaling (Ã…dlandsvik and Bentsen, 2007).
Alternatively any ROMS history or average file could be used with minor
modifications of the examples.
